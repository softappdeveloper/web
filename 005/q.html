        <p>Jean 1:1a dit <q>au commencement etait la parole</q>. 
            Daccord....</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The W3C page <cite>About W3C</cite> says the W3C's
            mission is <q cite="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/">To lead the
            World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and
            guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web</q>. I
            disagree with this mission.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>In <cite>Example One</cite>, he writes <q>The man
            said <q>Things that are impossible just take longer</q>. I
            disagreed with him</q>. Well, I disagree even more!</p>
        <hr>
        <p>His best argument was ❝I disagree❞, which
            I thought was laughable.</p>
