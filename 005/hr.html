            <p>Communication stones seem to come in pairs and have mysterious
            properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They can transfer thoughts in two directions once activated
                if used alone.</li>
                <li>If used with another device, they can transfer one's
                consciousness to another body.</li>
                <li>If both stones are used with another device, the
                consciousnesses switch bodies.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <p>Radios use the electromagnetic spectrum in the meter range and
            longer.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Signal flares use the electromagnetic spectrum in the
            nanometer range.</p>
