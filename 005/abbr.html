            You can use <abbr>CSS</abbr> (Cascading Style Sheets) 
            to style your <abbr>HTML</abbr> (HyperText Markup Language). 
            Using style sheets, you can keep your <abbr>CSS</abbr> 
            presentation layer and <abbr>HTML</abbr> content layer 
            separate. This is called "separation of concerns."
